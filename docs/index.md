# Smart Home Project
A little classical though, & also made use of whatever i had !<br/>
`Smart `, Its not exactly that the Home is connected to the internet but, uses TV remote which has IR sensor to control the Relay (more like electric switches). <br/>


## A little Back Story
It was covid time, round & round it was close close close. Straight away 1 & 1/2 year in home ! , and was Completely broke. 
<br/>
Anyways the problem was 'The Morning', you know, need fan during night for sound sleep & same time in the morning it would be too cold ! still, the fan is ON. Need a way to turn it OFF without getting up.
<br/>

## Hence,  The Lazy Code !.

- Gathered everything i had, 
    - Arduino UNO
    - IR sensor
    - old TV remote 
    - 4 channel relay module
    - & 3-pin sockets,  switches, indicator, wires, The Case etc.

## Next ?

Here is the video [**`-> link <-`**](https://youtu.be/yADLIZVvrqg) for the complete project. Everything you need.<br />

The lazy code itself [**`-> link <-`**](https://github.com/sudharshanakshay/The_lazy_Code).<br />
